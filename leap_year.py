### Pseudo Code ###
# Get user input for a year and convert it to an integer.
# Check if the year is divisible by 4.
# If true, check if the year is also divisible by 100.
# If true, check if the year is also divisible by 400.
# If true, print "Leap year".
# If false, print "Not leap year".
# If false, print "Leap year".
# If false, print "Not a leap year".

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
